# Houston : bug tracker tool

"Okay, Houston, I believe we've had a problem here". This truthful quotation used the past and the hypothesis formula. These two remarks illustrates two facts :
- action time is not always explanation time (furthermore if there is stress and urgency during work time),
- affirmative declaration about bug are not formulated so easily when we have criticism and analysis spirit.

## Main goal

Houston bug tracker tool has two main goals :
- not to slow down your work,
- not to encourage you to be too quickly sure of your words.

## Return on experience

There are true stories and sometimes difficult use of bug tracker tool before to propose this tool.
- too many fields were mandatory in first submitting incident,
- some fields encourage to input wrong or aleatory informations, about for example reproductibility and gravity.

## Minimum Viable Product

A KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid product owner..) approach is the first conducting line.   
Do less but with better quality and business value. 
Furthermore, have solid basis and save and maintain this nominal version during all lifecycle product is a good practice. When the Marketable Viable Product will be too complicated and failed all the time, the rollback to a simple and robust version will be a good way to save the product life.

## Features

Concerning feature the MVP version focuses on depth  and not on width treatment. Create and maintain a robust technical and user experienced basis is the main goal of this first product version.
